# Render-Time-Prediction-with-Machine-Learning

We tried to find the factors affecting rendering, and we thus can predict render time with different machine learning methods on Blender render engine such as SVM and random forest, and so on.

In this project, I was in charge of extracting data (e.g., calculating points and coverage.) from Blender to provide a dataset for machine learning.
